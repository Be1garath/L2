# Technical Specification of Layer 2 Blockchain Scalability Solutions for Ethereum Virtual Machine Compatible public Blockchains

## Background
Blockchain scalability solutions that are not native to a public blockchain such as the Ethereum Layer 2 ecosystem are experiencing rapid growth around DeFi applications and the technical maturation of its solutions. Layer 2 scalability solutions in all their different technical facets have emerged not only as a solution to public Blockchain congestion but also as a way for Enterprises to utilize the advantages of public Blockchains -- security, data integrity, DeFi assets, and DeFi financial products -- without sacrificing data privacy and regulatory compliance.

Layer 2 scalability solutions are not to be confused with the OSI model Layer 2 protocols or data link layer. For the purposes of this standard, layer 2 is a secondary protocol that is built on top of an existing Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchain (referred to as layer 1) and is dependent on layer 1 for continued operation.

## Goals
* Develop standards and methods for Layer 2 Blockchain protocols that minimize harm to EVM compatible public Blockchains. For example, support Zero Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) or do not reduce economic security assurances, 
* Develop standards and methods for Layer 2 Blockchain protocols that optimize value along multiple value dimensions. For example, Total-Value-Locked (TVL), MEV, security, accessibility, asset diversity, etc., 
* Develop standards and methods for Layer 2 Blockchain protocols that further ecosystem diversity e.g. making EVM compatible public Blockchains attractive for enterprises, increasing the number of monthly users (MUs);
* Develop standards and methods for Layer 2 Blockchain protocols that reduce adoption friction for enterprises, tooling, and mainstream software developers
* Develop standards and methods for Layer 2 Blockchain protocols that can further equitable access and usage of EVM compatible public Blockchains. For example, low L2 transaction fees, transaction diversity in blocks, etc.
* Develop standards and methods that facilitate interoperability between applications and different  Layer 2 Blockchain protocols, and among different  Layer 2 Blockchain protocols and EVM compatible Layer 1s.
* Gather and document information about existing L2 EVM compatible public blockchains to understand existing implementations and how they would meet and relate to the standards that are being developed.

## Scope
* Identify and document the most relevant use cases and business requirements for Layer 2 and other Blockchain Scalability solutions for EVM compatible public blockchains
* Define a technical standard with identification and differentiation of classes of scalability solutions as required that meet both ecosystem and enterprise requirements, with a particular focus on interoperability between Layer 2 solutions for EVM compatible public blockchains
* For EVM compatible public blockchains, identify, document, and devise solution approaches for Layer 2 Blockchain scalability solution specific challenges such as MEV, block (gas) limits, TVL concentration, etc.
* Identify and document characteristics of Layer 2 Blockchain environments for EVM compatible public blockchains that will be key in addressing mainstream and enterprise adoption.
